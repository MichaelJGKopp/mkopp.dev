# US-04 – Documentation & Showcase

**Story**  
As a recruiter, I want to read the design document and ADRs directly on the site, so that I can evaluate the developer’s technical decision-making.  

**Acceptance Criteria**  

- See: [documentation-showcase.feature](../../apps/mysite-backend/src/test/resources/features/documentation-showcase.feature)
